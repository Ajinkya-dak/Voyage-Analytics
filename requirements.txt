# Direct, high-level dependencies for your DAG tasks, model code, and app.py functions
# (assuming these are called by Airflow's PythonOperator)

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn>=0.22
joblib
flask # Only include this if your Airflow PythonOperators will import code from app.py that needs Flask

# Add other DIRECT high-level dependencies if your DAGs/model scripts import them:
# For example:
# requests
# google-cloud-storage
# google-auth
# matplotlib
# seaborn
# fastapi
# uvicorn
# pydantic
